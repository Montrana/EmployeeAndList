# EmployeeAndList
This is assignment 2 from CS-303 at UMKC
Name: Montana Nicholson
Date: June 23rd, 2023

1. I ran into some issues with the list portion, I ended up getting an error for
LNK2019	unresolved external symbol "public: __cdecl Single_Linked_List<int>::Single_Linked_List<int>(void)" (??0?$Single_Linked_List@H@@QEAA@XZ) referenced in function main
or something similar that wouldn't let me test the code. I unfortunately didn't know how to resolve this error so I am submitting it as is.

2. For the employee section I mostly just instantiated a nonprofessional and a professional employee and printed out the data for each to show it as an example of class inheritance.
